# Video Integration

- For Local Library, Namida is capable of playing videos related to the music, Video can be found either locally or fetched from youtube

<details>
<summary>

###### How locally?

</summary>
typically looks (inside the folders you specificed) for any matching title, matching goes as following:
<br>
-- Alan walker - Faded.m4a
<br>
-- video alAn WaLkER - faDed (480p).mp4
<br>
the video filename should contain at least one of the following:
 <br>
   1. the music filename as shown above.
 <br>
   2. title & first artist of the track.
 <br>
   3. track youtube id (in track comment tag/filename, see "#How youtube?" section below).
<br>
note: some cleanup is made to improve the matching, all symbols & whitespaces are ignored.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

###### How youtube?

</summary>

  - looks up in the track comment tag (as they are mostly done by @yt-dlp) or filename for any matching youtube link, if found then it starts downloading (and caches) and plays once it's ready, streaming here isn't a good idea as the priority goes for the music file itself.
    - for comment tag, any url format should get matched normally.
    - for filenames, it should contain `v=video_id` or `id=video_id` in order to get matched.
  
</details>

- Since v4.0.0, full video library indexing & playback is supported, videos can now be played independently, as well as dedicated videos folder view.
